 Machine Learning–Based Construction Equipment Prediction System
 A machine learning system that predicts the number of construction equipment (cranes, trucks, excavators, etc.) needed for construction projects. It adjusts predictions based on project details and weather conditions to improve planning and resource allocation.
 
 Features:
 
📊 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Handles project data, equipment numbers, and weather information.

🌤️ Weather-Aware Predictions: Adjusts equipment requirements based on temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

🤖 Model Training & Evaluation: Trains ML models and evaluates prediction accuracy.

🛠️ Realistic Validation: Validates predictions using completed projects for reliability.

Usage:

Open the notebook (notebook.ipynb) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Provide project details (area, type, sector) and weather conditions.

Run the prediction cells to see the estimated equipment requirements.

Example inputs and outputs are included in the user_interface screenshots.

Goal:

Enable data-driven decisions to optimize resource allocation, improve planning efficiency, and minimize risks in construction projects.

Tech Stack / Tools:

Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization)

ML Frameworks: Scikit-learn, PyTorch

Models Trained:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting 

Interactive Tools: ipywidgets for dynamic user input (Colab)

Environment: Google Colab

Data Processing & Feature Engineering: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, weather-based adjustments

Validation / Evaluation: Train/test split, cross-validation, evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE)
